# DH110-Assignment-3-Contextual-Inquiry
## Step 01: Specify the research goal & requirements? 
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
> This project will support users who are in need of food services and other basic needs easier to access through the College of the Desert’s school website. This will hopefully make the student body happier and increase retention rates to complete their post-secondary goals because when their basic needs are met, people are more likely to be less stressed and more focused. 
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
> The basic need is when the user has difficult access to nutritional whole food or does not have the means to pay for that food.  It can also be a friend, counselor, classmate, family member, or anyone else related to the user that can search for these resources on behalf of them. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> Traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy this need of access to whole foods are looking up food pantries on Google and adding your location on top of it. There can also be outreach through the local church with announcements after the ritual or mass. Another solution is through regular old flyers posted on the announcements board. The easiest is the first option as long as someone has a device that connects to the internet. The last two solutions only grasps a certain population and relies on word of mouth for people to go to the food pantry if they need their services.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved? 
> Traditional/current solutions have limitations such as accommodating students that are busy.
Limitations specifically for this College of the Desert website is that primarily focuses on registration, current students, and faculty. The website assumes that users have the internet literacy to sift through the tabs and links to find this information on this website. 
## Step 02: Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? 
> Demographic: College of the Desert students, local to the Coachella Valley, college aged students, non-traditional college students

> Preferences: Facing difficulty to fulfill their basic needs like food, water, and shelter or just additional help within their everyday lives. 

> Expertise: No level of expertise required to use this application.

### Where would the users do that activity?
> User would do this activity on the COD website either on their phone on a desktop. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? 
> They would have to find the student resources page. There’s a likelier chance that users will use the search bar to skip steps to find the page.

## Step 03: Pick an observation method
### The observation method I employed was contextual inquiry. My participant lives far away, so this session was conducted remotely over Zoom. I had several activities with the participant to explore her knowledge of world hunger and her perspective of it as well. 

### The session consisted of the following sections: 
- Background questions
- User activities
- Follow-up questions

## Insights from the interview

### How was your experience when you used the food pantry? Have you used it recently or just when you were younger? \\ 15:00 (Part 1)
> 15:00 It was mostly when I was younger. I think I um, I volunteered when I was about thirteen or fourteen, but that doesn't count but um! They were nice when I was there. Um, I didn't really feel like bad, or anything, even as a kid. I didn't feel like we were poor or anything. They were very kind, and like not judgmental.
15:18 I could tell that my mom was like nervous when she went, and I picked up on that. But they were just super nice people.

### User Activity 1: How has the pandemic impacted food insecure communities? \\ 17:30 (Part 2)
> 17:34 Yeah, I just know um like off of my experience of what I've seen like. It was pretty bad when Covid first hit um like
17:43 I mean all the stores were cleared. Um, there, we really like it wasn't just the toilet paper thing like we didn't have like. I remember going to a Walmart, and there wasn't pasta like there wasn't any like.
17:54 All the frozen stuff was gone like the only thing I could find was a bag of like potato wedges. I just remember that very distinctly was that I went out to get food, and I only got one bag of potato wedges because that was all they had, and I went home, and I looked off that for a week.

### Thoughts during the user activity on the search engine: (Part 2) 
I usually get like the most concrete results, like even just here the rest of the page. That's why, like Google, Because I don't even have to click on anything.

### Thoughts during User Activity 1 (Part 2) \\ 29:58
> 29:58 I can contribute that to a variety of things um mainly that people just don't know about cal fresh um if they, if they're eligible doesn't mean that they know, especially if, like they're really in poverty, like if they're homeless, and they don't have like means to access that information through the Internet would.

### Thoughts during User Activity 2 (Part 2) \\ 37:45
> 37:45 Yes, it's two thousand five hundred and eighty percent increase from one thousand nine hundred and seventy. That's great. That's great. Yeah. So that contributes a lot. Um, even. I mean, i'm on like the fast phone. Everything as like cheap as I can get it, and still, 5k a semester, so thats a lot for my family. But way cheaper than like this. But yeah it's still [a lot]. Even with the help, I'm still food insecure for a lot of my college life has been dealing with that.

> 41:16 um yeah, it's just I feel like It's a very like American struggle to. As you can see, this is in Houston, but just constantly having to juggle what you can afford for the month, even though they're necessities. Every month. You're just going to be like, okay. Well, maybe this isn't as much of a necessity, even though it's still a necessity every month. If you're not generally secure, even if your middle class I feel like you're gonna have to deal with that at some point, unless you're very comfortably rich.

### Reflection: What's the ost difficult part of preventing hunger in your daily life? (Part 3) \\ 44:30
> Um as a full time student, it's hard for me to even find time for a job without like sacrificing my studies. So like I have five classes. I study probably about three hours a day doing homework on average.
44:48 And my classes are at odd times, so like I can't find like a part time job that wouldn't like have me sacrifice like my rates, which means I can't realistically afford rent for food.So now i'm living with my mom at twenty, one and i'm going to be here in 2022 which prevents my mom from like moving into her house that she has in Reno, Nevada, for, like other year. So it's just like It's a domino effect like I can't get a job basically until i'm out of college. It's going to sustain me, and even then it's a toss up, because most middle class people still struggle with that. So it's just a domino effect, and I feel like it's like that for a lot of people. It's just if it's not one thing, it's another...

### Reflection: What's the most difficult part of finding resources when you are in need of critical help? (Part 3) \\ 45:45
> 45:47 For finding resources. Um, I would say It's that hard to find them. It's really just harder to like mentally prepare to like, Go in and like ask for help. I feel like people generally struggle with that more than finding resources. Um, i'd say, if you're homeless, genuinely homeless, with no phone or anything that could be a contributor. Then you can't even look up resources unless you go to a library or somewhere where there's free access to Internet, But um, yeah, for me, I didn't have that problem. It was just going into the place.

### Reflection: Can you rate the importance of this issue on a scale from 1-10? (Part 3) \\ 49:00
> 49:02 And it's just absurd right? Because, like you don't hear that many people talking about it, but like it's true like. I'm not that food insecure right now, but I still am, and I have been like really hard before as a child. I know people don't like to talk about it, but everybody experiences it, I think, at some point. I mean the majority of people do not.
49:30 People are one paycheck away. If you take a paycheck away from a middle class person like they're homeless because they don't, they typically don't have like this the means to save money, because it's always going to something else. And I think about that a lot.

## Reflection 
#### When I went into this interview, I thought it would be kind of like catching up with an old friend from community college. I didn’t expect to have this much of an open, honest, and vulnerable conversation with her. I really enjoyed listening to her thought process and her past experiences that lead to her viewpoint on the U.S. hunger crisis. She really brought up good points on how the hurdles that college students face and how it can be amplified with hunger. I also really appreciated the macro lens she brought to the conversation by applying her own knowledge and reading in between the lines of the statistics. I also like that she had personal anecdotes to assist as evidence. The questions I had were modeled after the Marina Souliman’s script and a little bit of Tasia Mochernek’s script. They gave me the foundation to initiate and close out the interview. I didn’t focus much on College of the Desert’s website so I can find other pathways to prevent hunger in college students, but if I have time, I might do an extra interview with her for the nitty gritty details. For the website, I think it will be important to provide personal stories to highlight the importance of offering food services so that people are more inclined to share this information with someone in need. Statistics can also help give a rough idea in the user's head how wide the scale of an issue is, but the personal stories can make the hunger crisis more tangible to tackle with one less hungry stomach at a  time. This was an interesting homework assignment that will definitely guide the design process and prevent personal biases.
